# ðŸ“– Starling Bank API samples

This repository contains various code samples to make it easy to integrate with the Starling API. We can't wait to see what cool stuff you'll make! 

As with everything we do at Starling, we'd love to learn how we could make stuff better. If you have any feedback, contact us on the [Starling Developer Slack](https://developer.starlingbank.com/community).

For more information about the Starling API, see the documentation on the [developer portal](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs).
